# PRBNet_Pytorch for Oriented Bounding Boxes

The codes here are mostly based on the [hukaixuan19970627/yolov5_obb](https://github.com/hukaixuan19970627/yolov5_obb) with the following add-ons:

- From [WongKinYiu/yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7):
	- Model common modules
	- Detection layers with implicit knowledge / auxiliary head (IDetect, IAuxDetect, IBin)
	- SimOTA loss
- PoolFormer modules for backbone model 
- The code implementations of [Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature Pyramid Network](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2021.3118953)

# Installation & Getting started

Please refer to the [yolov5_obb README](./yolov5obb_README.md) to get started.
